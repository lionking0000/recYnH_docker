[What is recYnH?]

This program is taking recYnH sequencing files and generating recYnH Scores to correponding sequences.

We assumed that the sequencing format is the same as we described in Nature Communication 2018 Paper.

# After setting proper parameter in recYnH.py file
# User can run the program as following command

# python recYnH.py


# Typical result

[ Starting recY2H Analysis ]
[ Read No-selection Sequence File ] ./data/XXXX.fastq.gz
[ Read Selection Sequence File ] ./data/YYYY.fastq.gz
[ Calculating recY2H Scores ]
[ Finishing recY2H Analysis ]


# It will gives recY2H Scores for all the sequences
